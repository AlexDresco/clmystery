The Command Line Murder
========================

Worked on this challenge during the Makers pre-course. 

" There's been a murder in Terminal City, and TCPD needs your help.

The rules were to only use the command line and no text editors. 

## Investigate

Each step of your investigation will contain a reference to the **Detective Handbook** at the top. Each page of the Detective Handbook contains the description of the commands you will need to complete that particular step. You can view them in the Terminal:

```bash
Reference: ./detective_handbook/getting_started.md
```
Open a Terminal, go to the location of the files (using the `cd` command), and start by reading the file 'step0'.

One way you can do this is with following command:

    cat step0

(`cat` is a command that will print the contents of the file called `step0` for you to read.)
